Prompt:
---
// typescript
// Express middleware called registerHandler to handle POST requests to /register
// The middleware checks if the name, email and password are in the request body
// If yes, the middleware returns with a 200 status code and { message: 'User created' }
// If something is missing, the middleware returns with a 400 status code and { message: 'Missing name, email or password' }
// The middleware saves the name, email and password to a file called ./users.json in the following format:
// {
//   "users": [
//     {
//       "name": "John Doe",
//       "email": "john.doe@example",
//       "password": "123456"
//     }
//   ]
// }
// The middleware checks for the existence of the users.json file and creates it if it doesn't exist
// The middleware does not save already existing users but returns with a 400 status code and { message: 'User already exists' }
// Use Typescript types everywhere
// The middleware is default exported with export default
