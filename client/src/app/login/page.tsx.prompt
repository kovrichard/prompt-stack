Give me a simple but nice minimalistic login page in Next.js.
Use Tailwind utility classes. The form should have an email and a password field and should be reactive.
At the bottom, there should be a submit button.
Also add a link to the registration page at /register, when users don't have an account yet.
The login request should be POSTed to http://localhost:3001/login using the fetch API.
Don't use <a> in <Link> tags. It is invalid syntax in the newest version of Next.js.
Write only the code, no need for the setup steps.
