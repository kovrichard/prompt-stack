Give me a simple but nice minimalistic login page in Next.js.
Use Tailwind utility classes. The form should have an email and a password field and should be reactive.
At the bottom, there should be a submit button.
Also add a link to the registration page at /register, when users don't have an account yet.
The login request should be POSTed to http://localhost:3001/login using the fetch API.
Don't use <a> in <Link> tags. It is invalid syntax in the newest version of Next.js.
Make sure the color of texts is different from the background color.
Write only the code, no need for the setup steps and explanation. It must be copy-paste ready.
