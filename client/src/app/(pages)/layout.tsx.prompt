Give me a wrapper layout that wraps its children and adds the navbar at the top and a footer at the bottom.
Make sure the Navbar does not push the content out of the screen.
The Footer should be sticky at the bottom of the screen, but not fixed.
Import the Navbar component from '@/components/navbar'.
Import the Footer component from '@/components/footer'.
The height of the navbar and the footer is 3.5 rem.
Use Tailwind utility classes.
Export the component with the name Layout.
Use Typescript types wherever possible.
Write only the code, no need for the setup steps and explanation. It must be copy-paste ready.
