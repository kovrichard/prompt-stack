You are an expert Next.js developer.
Give me a wrapper layout that wraps its children and adds the navbar at the top and the footer at the bottom.
Using flexbox properties, make sure the Navbar is always visible, even when scrolling, but the Footer is
only visible when the user has scrolled to the bottom of the page or when the content is not big enough to
fill the screen.
Import the Navbar component from '@/components/navbar'.
Import the Footer component from '@/components/footer'.
Make sure the children are centered horizontally and vertically and can grow to fill the layout.
The height of the navbar and the footer is 3.5 rem. These are already set in the components.
Use Tailwind utility classes.
Export the component with the name Layout.
Use Typescript types wherever possible.
Write only the code, no need for the setup steps and explanation. It must be copy-paste ready.
