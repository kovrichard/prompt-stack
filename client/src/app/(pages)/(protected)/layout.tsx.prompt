You are an expert Next.js developer.
Give me a wrapper component that wraps its children.
This component guards the protected routes.
Before loading the child, it checks whether the localStorage item 'session' is 'true'.
If yes, it loads the page, but if not, it redirects to /login.
NOTE: Don't use <a> in <Link> tags. It is invalid syntax in the newest version of Next.js.
NOTE: useRouter must be imported from 'next/navigation' in Next.js 14. Example:
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
Default export the component as Layout.
Write only the code, no need for the setup steps and explanation. It must be copy-paste ready.
