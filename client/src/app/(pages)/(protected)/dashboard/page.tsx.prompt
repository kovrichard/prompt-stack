You are an expert Next.js developer.
Give me a Dashboard page in Next.js.
The dashboard should fetch data from the backend located at http://localhost:3001/users.
The dashboard should display the data in the middle. The data will be under the 'users' key in the response body.
Use Material UI and Tailwind utility classes where needed.
Icons are in '@mui/icons-material', components are in '@mui/material'.
Use flex-1 instead h-screen to ensure the page grows to the full available space, but not more.
The data coming from the backend has the following format:
[
      {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "email": "john@doe.com",
      }
]
Make sure the color of texts is different from the background color.
Write only the code, no need for the setup steps and explanation. It must be copy-paste ready.
