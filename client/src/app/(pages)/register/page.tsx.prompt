Give me a simple but nice minimalistic register page in Next.js.
Use Tailwind utility classes. The form should have a name, email, and a password field and should be reactive.
At the bottom, there should be a submit button.
Also add a link to the login page at /login, when users already have an account.
The register request should be POSTed to http://localhost:3001/register using the fetch API.
Don't use <a> in <Link> tags. It is invalid syntax in the newest version of Next.js.
Make sure the color of texts is different from the background color.
Write only the code, no need for the setup steps and explanation. It must be copy-paste ready.
