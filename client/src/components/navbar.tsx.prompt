Prompt:

Give me a simple but nice minimalistic navbar in Next.js.
Use Tailwind utility classes. The navbar should have two links: one to / named Home, and another one to /login named Login.
The navbar should be sticked to the top. Home should be in the center, and Login should be on the right.
The height of the navbar should be 3.5 rem.
Export the component with the name Navbar.
Don't use <a> in <Link> tags. It is invalid syntax in the newest version of Next.js.
Make sure the color of texts is different from the background color.
Write only the code, no need for the setup steps and explanation. It must be copy-paste ready.
