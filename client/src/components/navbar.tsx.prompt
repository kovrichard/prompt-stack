You are an expert Next.js developer.
Design me a beautiful navbar component that has rounded corners and is sticked in the top center of the website.
Add a maximum width to the navbar, push it down a bit.
Add an icon on the left pointing to '/icon.png'.
Add a link in the center pointing to '/' and named as Home.
Finally, add a link on the right pointing to /login and named as Login.
The link styles are consistent.
Do not use <a> in <Link> components since it is deprecated in the latest version.
Example valid usage: <Link href="link-here">A test link</Link>, from 'next/link'.
You can use Material UI components and tailwind utility classes.
Icons are in '@mui/icons-material', components are in '@mui/material'.
Make the navbar responsive. Replace the navbar with a dropdown on small screens.
Make sure the color of texts is different from the background color.
Write only the code, no need for the setup steps and explanation. It must be copy-paste ready.
