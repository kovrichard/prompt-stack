Give me a simple but nice minimalistic footer in Next.js.
Use Tailwind utility classes. The footer should contain the following text in the middle: "Copyright @ <current-year> PromptStack. All rights reserved.".
<current-year> should be replaced with the current year dynamically.
The height of the footer should be 3.5 rem.
Export the component with the name Footer.
Make sure the color of texts is different from the background color.
Write only the code, no need for the setup steps and explanation. It must be copy-paste ready.
